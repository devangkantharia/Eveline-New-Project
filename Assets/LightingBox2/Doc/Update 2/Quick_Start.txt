Hi

Before start go to Edit->project->Player settings and remove DirectX9 from Auto Graphics API section   

Lighting Box 2.0+ has been used Post Processing Stack 2 beta 2 as Post Processing effects. Also used True Volumetric Light asset as
Volumetric lighting. GlobalFog image effect for combining unity Fog with distance and height based fog solution   
Also used Legacy Cinematic Image Effects as Depth of Field and Screen Space Reflections effects (Has more options and quality)

Note : You can find default Lighting Profiles (looks like update 1 to 1.4) from here :
Assets->LightingBox2->Scripts->Profiles

If you want to import Lighting Box 2 into your new project, you can download small version (Only necessary components) into your
exiting project :
http://89.163.206.23/LightingBox2_3_1.zip

Then you need to set your project settings to following :

1. Go to Edit->Player and unchecked Auto Graphics API. Then remove DX9 api and only use DX11 , DX12 or Vulkan for windows.
Metal for Mac and iOS

2. You need to switch to Linear color space for next gen platforms (UE4 and most next gen game engines used only Linear).
It's possible to change from Lighting Box window

3. witch to deferred rendering path for better reflections and Screen Space Reflection support.

Note : Gamma color space and Forward rendering path has higher performance on low-end devices
