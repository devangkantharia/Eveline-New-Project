Hi ! and thank you :)

Quick instructions:
---------------------

Choose one of the 2 material examples in the package and go to your Terrain settings(the cog), Then
in the material dropdown choose "Custom" so you can put the lowpoly terrain material in there.

***IMPORTANT THINGS***
********************

** This shader was made thinking in Linear color space and Deferred lighting mode. **
** You may experience problems with the normal direction in forward mode, 
     so i've included a checkbox to invert the normals, at the end of the properties in the material. **
** Do not pay attention to the warning in the terrain settings, the shader works just fine :) **
